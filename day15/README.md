# day 15

annoyed with how long it took to get this one working, gave up on awk because it has no nested lists or dictionaries. Then had wierd issues with the python version.

chose to use lists over dictionaries because of the indexing, I thought that having to adjust the index of every value past the one I modified would make the benefit of using the dictionary redundant, I found some guy on reddits solution that used dictionaries and mine was faster sooo........
