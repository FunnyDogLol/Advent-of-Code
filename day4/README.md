# Day 4

Might come back to this one and see if I can speed this up, used too many lists.

Gave up on awk because large .awk files were just getting messy and awk had so many issues with weird behaviours slowing down solving the problems.

Modified the files with awk before running the python script on them to make it a bit smaller. Had fun doing the recursion this one.
